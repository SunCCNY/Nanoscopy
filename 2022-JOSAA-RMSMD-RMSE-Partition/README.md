## Purpose

The MATLAB codes, figures, and data movies are developed, generated and used in the paper: 

[1] Y. Sun, "Partition of estimated locations: an approach to accurate quality metrics for stochastic optical localization nanoscopy," JOSA A, vol. 39, no. 12, pp. 2307-2315, Dec. 2022.

## Run codes

The main program is MarkovModel_V4.m. It has two sections: 

Section (A): Cycled illumination for 3D imaging

Section (B): Continuous illumination for 2D imaging

Each of the sections can be run independently.
