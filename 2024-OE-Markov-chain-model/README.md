## Purpose

The MATLAB codes, figures, and data movies are developed, generated and used in the paper: 
[1] Y. Sun, "Markov chain models of emitter activations in single molecule localization microscopy," Optics Express, vol. 32, no. 19, pp. 33779-33794, Sept. 2024. 

## Run codes

The main program is MarkovModel_V4.m. It has two sections: 

Section (A): Cycled illumination for 3D imaging

Section (B): Continuous illumination for 2D imaging

Each of the sections can be run independently.
