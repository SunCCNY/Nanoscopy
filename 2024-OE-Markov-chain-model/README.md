The MATLAB codes, figures, and data movies are developed and used in the manuscript "Markov chain models of emitter activations in single molecule localization microscopy" submitted to Optical Express. 

The main program is MarkovModel_V4.m. It has two sections: 

Section (A): Cycled illumination for 3D imaging

Section (B): Continuous illumination for 2D imaging

Each of the sections can be run independently.
